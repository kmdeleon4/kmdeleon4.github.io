    <h4>Project Description:</h4>
    <p>During the course “Instructional Systems Design” (IS_LT 9471), we were instructed to create an online learning module. This semester-long project required us to go through the Analysis and Design portions of the standard ADDIE model. For our project, my partner and I conducted a needs analysis regarding a gap in sales performance at a new distribution site for a hydroponic equipment company. In addition to a needs analysis, we also conducted a task analysis, content analysis, and learner analysis to design an effective online training solution. During the design phase, we broke the information down into specific modules. Each module contained desired learning outcomes, assessments, and learning strategies. The assessment contains both formative assessments for each sub-module and culminated into a summative assessment at the end of the module. </p>

    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
    <p>This project is a great example of how a thorough analysis informs the design of the learning material. Each analysis helped us create meaningful learning objectives and appropriate assessments. It also ensured that the content of the learning modules focused on the knowledge gap of employees, rather than forcing employees to sit through unnecessary information. Focusing on the actual need allowed for efficient training that acknowledged the employees’ time and effort.</p> 

    <p>Several tools were used to create this project. Surveys and observations were used to collect analysis data. We organized this data through charts to help create a clearer picture of this situation, and how to best address each need identified. In order to create both the storyboards and visual prototypes we used Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>
        
     <p>Throughout the project, I learned the importance of collaboration and effective communication with my partner. Because this was such a large project, it was crucial to delegate tasks, manage timelines, and maintain open lines of communication to ensure success.
