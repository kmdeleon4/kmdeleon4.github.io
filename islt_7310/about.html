             <P><h3>My name is Kristin DeLeon, and I am an Instructional Designer</h3>I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2012 with a BS in Music Education and am currently working towards an MS in Learning Technologies and Design. From 2013 to 2015, I taught music to students in grades K-5. During this time, I discovered my passion for creating engaging learning experiences beyond traditional classrooms. In 2015, I joined Veterans United Home Loans as an Account Manager and later moved to the Learning and Development department in 2016.</P></p>As a Learning Experience Designer, I actively craft captivating online learning experiences for the company's employees. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with her husband, Ryan, and our pets. I also enjoy crocheting, drawing, and playing video games. My future goals involve advancing my instructional design skills and contributing to the development of impactful online training. I am determined to make a positive impact in the field of learning technologies and design.</P>
