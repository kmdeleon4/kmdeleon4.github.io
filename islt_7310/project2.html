    <h4>Project Description:</h4>
    <p>“Evaluation of LearnUpon LMS Course Presentation in a Corporate Environment” was a project completed for the course “Formative and Summative Evaluation” (IS_LT 9455). The goal of this project was to conduct a full formative evaluation of a new eLearning implementation process. In this evaluation, my partner and I collected and analyzed data on employee attitudes towards the new Learning Management System of a medium-sized mortgage company (5,000-10,000employees). To evaluate the new system, the evaluation focused on one course, titled Information Security, that all employees must complete every year during the annual compliance course training. Because the content of this course and its quiz do not change much year-to-year, we were presented with an opportunity to directly study the presentation method of previous years (A SCORM files uploaded into the old LMS) to the new model (a natively built course in the new LMS, LearnUpon).</p>

    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
    <p>This mixed methods, formative evaluation consisted of an analysis of employee-submitted help tickets, a survey of employee volunteers who had completed the course, observations of employees taking the course in LearnUpon, and an accessibility review conducted by an accessibility expert. The outcomes of this evaluation could influence stakeholders’ decisions on how to roll out courses in the future. At the conclusion of this project, the full report was presented to the company’s LMS Administrator (who had originally requested the evaluation). </p> 

    <p>I learned several valuable takeaways from this project. This project demonstrated to me the amount of preparation that is required before a training evaluation is conducted. I also gained insight on how to conduct an evaluation that could help drive and improve future learning initiatives. </p>
