    Throughout my career as a Learning Experience Designer, I have gained many important experiences and
    skills. These include designing and developing instructional materials, managing projects, creating graphics,
    editing audio and video, making animations, designing websites, and ensuring a good user experience. I really
    love what I do because it allows me to combine my passion for beautiful design with my drive to create
    effective learning solutions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As a lifelong learner, I always strive to improve my skills and learn new techniques and tools. I have become
    skilled in various software programs such as Articulate 360, Camtasia, Adobe Captivate, Vyond, and Microsoft
    Office. I also have experience with curriculum design, technical writing, and using the Adobe Creative Suite,
    which includes Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Animate, Acrobat, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Lightroom,
    Fresco, Dreamweaver, Audition, Animate, and Character Animator. I enjoy utilizing different tools to create
    effective and engaging learner experiences.
    </p>

    Though I work in the financial services industry, my team creates learning experiences for all the different
    departments and roles within the company. I had the opportunity to create online courses on a wide range of
    topics. These include leadership skills, soft skills, IT, software, benefits, federal policies, personal development,
    professional development, team building, and conflict resolution. I enjoy the diversity of subjects and the
    opportunity to help people learn and grow in different areas.

    <h3>
        Career goals
    </h3>
    <p>
    My career goals involve continuing to grow my skills to make a positive impact in my field. I am excited to take
    what I have learned in my Learning Technologies and Design master’s program and apply it to my future work.
    Using innovative approaches and techniques I believe that I can create learning experiences that are engaging
    and effective, while making efficient use of the learner’s time. Ultimately, I want to create meaningful learning
    experiences that empower individuals and organizations to succeed.
