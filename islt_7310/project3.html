    <h4>Project Description:</h4>
    <p>The course “Research Methods in Information Science and Learning Technologies” (IS_LT 9450) required each student to write and submit a research proposal of their choice. My proposal, titled “Motivation and Effectiveness of Online Learning in Adults in a Corporate Setting”, explored what motivates adults to complete corporate online learning. This proposal consisted of a literature review of existing research, formulation of research questions, data collection methods, research methods, and a data analysis plan. </p>
    <p>My methods consisted of interviews current employees at a company who have completed online training within the past year. These interviews would cover their experience taking online training, their attitudes, their motivations, and how effective they felt the online training was regarding their everyday tasks. As job training and the positions themselves continue to shift to online-only, the researchers feel that data regarding these topics will play an important role in company decisions and increasing job satisfaction.</p>

    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
    <p>When reviewing existing literature on the topic, I discovered there are several studies on the motivation of adults to complete online learning in the academic setting, there is less research on the factors that motivate adults to seek out or complete online training in a corporate setting. This may be because it is assumed adult employees will complete online training simply because it is required of them. While this may be true for required, skills-based training, this ignores the optional professional development courses that many corporations spend time and money to provide to their employees. In addition, looking into these motivating factors could have a significant impact on employee job satisfaction. If much of their training is online and they are not motivated to complete it, or they do not perceive it as effective, job satisfaction could take a hit to the point of an employee retention issue. As technology continues to develop, I feel it is important for instructional designers to study the advantages and disadvantages it may pose to our learners. </p>
